# Database-Operator

## Project Overview

Database-Operator is a Kubernetes Operator for managing the lifecycle of database clusters. This is an advanced-level learning project that demonstrates complex state machine implementation and high-availability architecture.

## Learning Objectives

- **Complex State Machine**: Database cluster state management
- **High Availability Architecture**: Primary-replica replication and failover
- **Data Persistence**: Data safety and consistency guarantees
- **Cluster Management**: Node discovery and cluster configuration

## Features

- ✅ Automated database cluster deployment
- ✅ Primary-replica replication configuration
- ✅ Automatic failover
- ✅ Data backup and restore
- ✅ Monitoring and alerting integration
- ✅ Rolling upgrade support

## Complexity Level

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Advanced)
